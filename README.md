# Code Sample for the 2021 lyft Software Engineering Apprenticeship


## Deployed URL: [https://brianrussell-lyft-sample.vercel.app/](https://brianrussell-lyft-sample.vercel.app/)

***

### Requirements:

- Accept a POST request to the route “/test”, which accepts one argument “string_to_cut”

- Return a JSON object with the key “return_string” and a string containing every third letter from the original string

(e.g.) If you POST {"string_to_cut": "iamyourlyftdriver"}, it will return: {"return_string": "muydv"}.

Note: To see expected behavior you can test against a current working example with the command: 
```
curl -X POST https://lyft-interview-test.glitch.me/test --data '{"string_to_cut": "iamyourlyftdriver"}' -H 'Content-Type: application/json'
```
